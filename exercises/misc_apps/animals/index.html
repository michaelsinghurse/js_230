          The <strong>fox squirrel</strong>, also known as the eastern fox 
          squirrel or Bryant's fox squirrel, is the largest species of tree 
          squirrel native to North America. Despite the differences in size 
          and coloration, they are sometimes mistaken for American red 
          squirrels or eastern gray squirrels in areas where the species 
          co-exist.

        <figcaption>
          <strong>Skunks</strong> are North and South American mammals. 
          While related to polecats and other members of the weasel family, 
          skunks have as their closest Old World relatives the stink badgers. 
          The animals are known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong, 
          unpleasant smell. Different species of skunk vary in appearance from 
          black-and-white to brown, cream or ginger colored, but all have 
          warning coloration.

          The <strong>blue jay</strong> is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae, 
          native to eastern North America. It resides through most of eastern and central 
          United States, although western populations may be migratory. Resident 
          populations are also found in Newfoundland, Canada, while breeding 
          populations can be found across southern Canada. It is predominantly 
          blue with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a 
          black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the 
          crest.

          The <strong>turkey</strong> is a large bird, which is native to 
          the Americas. The genus has two extant species: the wild turkey of 
          North America and the ocellated turkey. Males of both turkey species 
          have a distinctive fleshy wattle or protuberance that hangs from the 
          top of the beak. They are among the largest birds in their ranges.
